&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</asset:title><asset:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doreen keeps pushing Robert to accept a challenging new assignment. She reassures him he&amp;rsquo;ll be great at it&amp;mdash;but he&amp;rsquo;s still resisting. A professional coach advises Doreen to give Robert more control over the decision&amp;mdash;by finding out what his concerns are and deciding how to address them together. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</asset:description><asset:biography xsi:nil="false">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coach&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stevenson Carlebach &lt;/b&gt;is an independent management consultant and trainer who helps clients learn how to communicate, negotiate, and resolve disputes effectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to becoming a consultant, Stevenson was associate professor and Chair of the theater department of Connecticut College, where he founded the Holleran Center for Community Action and Public Policy. The multidisciplinary academic center focuses on teaching, learning, and community collaboration. He currently teaches a course on mediation and conflict resolution within Harvard Law School&amp;rsquo;s Program on Negotiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevenson also holds a BA in classics from Tufts University and a Masters in Fine Arts with a specialty in theater directing from Boston University. He is the father of six children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doreen Collins&amp;rsquo; &lt;/b&gt;show business career began at the tender age of eight in front of 20,000 people, performing with Diana Ross and the Supremes. Since then, she has been an active member of SAG, AFTRA, and AGVA and has performed Off-Broadway and on television, film, and radio. Doreen&amp;rsquo;s one-woman show &amp;ldquo;BOOZICAL the Musical: The Unorganized Biography of Doreen Collins&amp;rdquo; is proof there is nothing that can embarrass her! She lives to perform. She&amp;rsquo;s the host of &amp;ldquo;Rhode Bytes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Unreal Deal&amp;rdquo; two shows on TV that air periodically on Saturday nights on NBC 10 in Rhode Island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doreen studied under Stella Adler as a theater major at NYU.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Woo&lt;/b&gt; is the Marketing Manager at InsightSquared. A student of viral marketing and comedy, his goal is to mesh these two aspects at every turn in his professional career. Robert tries comedy in improv currently with Hard Left Productions, and stand-up currently in front of a mirror. He writes sketches and web series; acts for various commercials; directs improv off and on; and plays the guitar just enough to maintain his calluses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert has performed in various festivals in Boston, Lowell, Chicago, New York, Providence, Sarasota, Tokyo, Atlanta, Lowell, Vancouver, and Austin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert studied at Tufts University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</asset:biography><asset:assetCollection><asset:asset>1_huvaptn7</asset:asset><asset:asset>1_uu4kd5et</asset:asset><asset:asset>1_dw0p5kbe</asset:asset></asset:assetCollection></asset:playlist>
