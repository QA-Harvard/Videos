People Like You&lt;/p&gt;</asset:title><asset:description>&lt;p&gt;Mike&amp;rsquo;s trying to
boost diversity in his team. But while recruiting, he&amp;rsquo;s drawn to people who are
like him. A professional coach offers advice for avoiding this common bias&amp;mdash;such
as asking all job candidates the same set of questions to objectively assess
their qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;</asset:description><asset:biography xsi:nil="false">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coach&lt;/span&gt;
