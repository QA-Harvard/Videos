She keeps raving about its advantages, but he&amp;rsquo;s still unconvinced. A professional coach shares a simple but powerful tip: Ask Robert about his concerns&amp;mdash;you&amp;rsquo;ll make him feel heard, which can lessen resistance to a new idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doreen Collins&lt;/b&gt;'
show business career began at the tender age of eight in front of 20,000
people, performing with Diana Ross and the Supremes. Since then, she has been
an active member of SAG, AFTRA, and AGVA and has performed Off-Broadway and on
television, film, and radio. Doreen&amp;rsquo;s one-woman show &amp;ldquo;BOOZICAL the Musical: The
Unorganized Biography of Doreen Collins&amp;rdquo; is proof there is nothing that can
embarrass her! She lives to perform. She&amp;rsquo;s the host of &amp;ldquo;Rhode Bytes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The
Unreal Deal&amp;rdquo; two shows on TV that air periodically on Saturday nights on NBC 10
in Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;

under Stella Adler as a theater major at NYU.&lt;/p&gt;

career. Robert tries comedy in improv currently with Hard Left Productions, and
stand-up currently in front of a mirror. He writes sketches and web series;
acts for various commercials; directs improv off and on; and plays the guitar
just enough to maintain his calluses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert has
performed in various festivals in Boston, Lowell, Chicago, New York,
Providence, Sarasota, Tokyo, Atlanta, Lowell, Vancouver, and Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
