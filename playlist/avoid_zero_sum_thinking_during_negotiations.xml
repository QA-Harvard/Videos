Tao knows he can&amp;rsquo;t finish the report by the new date but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to tell her that. A professional coach suggests an alternative approach to this &amp;ldquo;all or nothing&amp;rdquo; thinking: Find out how Doreen plans to use the report, then negotiate completion of sections she needs most.&lt;/p&gt;</asset:description><asset:biography xsi:nil="false">&lt;p&gt;Coach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tao Yang&lt;/b&gt; does everything that interests him with the flourish and dedication of a wonk, meaning that he is a data-wonk, improv-wonk, and computer-wonk. Tao is one of the hardest-working young comedy improvisers in the field. By day he is a data analyst at a healthcare information services company. By night he performs at ImprovBoston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tao started doing improv with Boston University&amp;rsquo;s Liquid Fun and taking classes at ImprovBoston. He graduated from BU and from ImprovBoston. He has been selected to join the cast of &amp;ldquo;Face Off,&amp;rdquo; and appears with his ImprovBoston team at Big Gulp 40 on the weekends. When he has the time, his usual schedule of studying, performing, and learning improv often consumes eight hours of his day.&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach to comedy is to never stop learning.&amp;rdquo; Tao seems to be living up to his own words on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doreen Collins&amp;rsquo;&lt;/b&gt; show business career began at the tender age of eight in front of 20,000 people, performing with Diana Ross and the Supremes. Since then, she has been an active member of SAG, AFTRA, and AGVA and has performed Off-Broadway and on television, film, and radio. Doreen&amp;rsquo;s one-woman show &amp;ldquo;BOOZICAL the Musical: The Unorganized Biography of Doreen Collins&amp;rdquo; is proof there is nothing that can embarrass her! She lives to perform. She&amp;rsquo;s the host of &amp;ldquo;Rhode Bytes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Unreal Deal&amp;rdquo; two shows on TV that air periodically on Saturday nights on NBC 10 in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doreen studied under Stella Adler as a theater major at NYU.&lt;/p&gt;</asset:biography><asset:assetCollection><asset:asset>1_xim85d6t</asset:asset><asset:asset>1_oyrxmdt3</asset:asset><asset:asset>1_oqp39la3</asset:asset></asset:assetCollection></asset:playlist>
