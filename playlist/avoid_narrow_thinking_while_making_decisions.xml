&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marcelo&amp;rsquo;s team has to decide what to do with a troubled advertising campaign. They keep debating two options - retain the campaign, or scrap it and start over. A professional coach shows how brainstorming a wider array of options can help the team get unstuck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</asset:description><asset:biography xsi:nil="false">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stevenson Carlebach i&lt;/b&gt;s an independent management consultant and trainer who helps clients learn how to communicate, negotiate, and resolve disputes effectively. He has worked extensively with Fortune 500 companies, including Goldman Sachs, BP Amoco, IBM, and Microsoft. His specialties include strategic relationship management, executive coaching, and difficult conversations. He worked with the Israeli Ministry of Education to develop conflict-resolution programming for schools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to becoming a consultant, Stevenson was associate professor and Chair of the theater department of Connecticut College, where he founded the Holleran Center for Community Action and Public Policy. The multidisciplinary academic center focuses on teaching, learning, and community collaboration. He currently teaches a course on mediation and conflict resolution within Harvard Law School&amp;rsquo;s Program on Negotiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevenson also holds a BA in classics from Tufts University and a Masters in Fine Arts with a specialty in theater directing from Boston University. He is the father of six children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marcelo Illarmo&lt;/b&gt; is a member of ImprovBoston. He is also an associate litigation lawyer with Sullivan &amp;amp; Worcester LLP who has represented a variety of clients from small construction firms to Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After performing with Liquid Fun&amp;rsquo;s inaugural cast at Boston University, Marcelo joined Face Off (formerly TheatreSports) before his senior year of college. In addition to performing with Face Off, he has performed in various shows, including a staging of his one-man show, &amp;ldquo;Tales of a Broken Heart.&amp;rdquo; His favorite memories of ImprovBoston include hosting the Sunday Night Jam with JR Strauss and performing an original musical he cowrote in college, &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ Mega Star.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marcelo graduated from Boston University with a BA, magna cum laude. He attended the Boston University School of Law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex LeBaron&lt;/b&gt; is an actor, improviser, writer, and instructor currently residing in Chicago. He is a founding member of Rich Uncle and has performed with the sketch groups Whippersnapper, Mosaic, and the Ruckus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex has appeared in numerous showcase shows, including: &amp;ldquo;Love Seasonally,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Wheel of Austen,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;T: An MBTA Musical,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;1.21 Jigowatts,&amp;rdquo; Manthorne and the Baron,&amp;rdquo; Gorefests IX and X, and &amp;ldquo;Playbook.&amp;rdquo; He has performed various shows at Duofest, Providence Improv Festival, Del Close Marathon, Philadelphia Improv Festival, and the North Carolina ComedyArts Festival. As First Person Interpreter at Bostonian Society, he presented historical materials to crowds of up to 75 in an educational and entertaining manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex received his Bachelor of Arts in international affairs and political science at the University of New Hampshire. He studied Spanish language and literature at the Pontificia Universidad Cat&amp;oacute;lica de Valpara&amp;iacute;so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Natalie Baseman &lt;/b&gt;is a comedian and a lady. She began writing and performing comedy professionally at ImprovBoston with the comedy groups Maxitor and The Dowry. She is pursuing an MFA in Writing for Screen and Television at the University of Southern California&amp;rsquo;s School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles. She is involved with Abso Lutely Productions and Comedy Bang! Bang! at the University of Southern California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Natalie has studied with teachers from the Annoyance, I.O., Upright Citizen&amp;rsquo;s Brigade, and Second City, including Mick Napier. While living in Edinburgh, she worked with the Edinburgh Improverts and the Parisian movement theater company, Dancing Brick. She also wrote/directed the solo sketch comedy show &amp;ldquo;Part Toaster/Part Worm,&amp;rdquo; which she has performed in Boston and Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tao Yang&lt;/b&gt; does everything that interests him with the flourish and dedication of a wonk, meaning that he is a data-wonk, improv-wonk, and computer-wonk. Tao is one of the hardest-working young comedy improvisers in the field. By day he is a data analyst at a healthcare information services company. By night he performs at ImprovBoston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tao started doing improv with Boston University&amp;rsquo;s Liquid Fun and taking classes at ImprovBoston. He graduated from BU and from ImprovBoston. He has been selected to join the cast of &amp;ldquo;Face Off,&amp;rdquo; and appears with his ImprovBoston team at Big Gulp 40 on the weekends. When he has the time, his usual schedule of studying, performing, and learning improv often consumes eight hours of his day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;My approach to comedy is to never stop learning.&amp;rdquo; Tao seems to be living up to his own words on the subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
