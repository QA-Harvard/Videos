She reacts&amp;mdash;by stubbornly standing her ground and then stomping away in a huff. A professional coach describes a simple but powerful process for persuading someone to change their unproductive ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</asset:description><asset:biography xsi:nil="false">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharon Grady&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the President of The Grady Company, a consulting firm that provides executives with the communication and conflict-management skills that drive their success as leaders. She specializes in teaching individuals and teams to excel at the challenging conversations they typically avoid or manage ineffectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before founding The Grady Company, Sharon was a consultant with Monitor and with Mercer Management Consulting, and served as Chief Operating Officer of Interaction Associates, a global provider of collaboration consulting and leadership education. She previously worked on Capitol Hill as a staff aide to U.S. Senator Abraham Ribicoff, and as press secretary to U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Kennelly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Morrell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rdquo; and an American politician, a CIA Deputy Director, and a modern mystic come up before Mike Morrell, actor and improviser, comes into view. Any of these characters are subjects Mike could impersonate with ease. He is the creator/director of &amp;ldquo;Crime Solving Bear&amp;rdquo; and the popular &amp;ldquo;DWA Presents.&amp;rdquo; He has filmed over 100 commercials and training videos with roles as varied and diverse as bad nurse, bad paper shredder, and bad employee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike has performed improv and stand-up all over Boston, New York, and Los Angeles. He is the cast member of TheartreSports as well as creator and cast member of the showcase show &amp;ldquo;UnAuthorized Biography.&amp;rdquo; He just filmed his first speaking role in a major production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christine Cuddy&lt;/b&gt;, who prefers to be called by her last name, is a seasoned actress. She grew up in the Boston area, where she trained in the performing arts.

Her favorite festival experience is performing in the Improv Allstar Show with Rachel Dratch at the Women in Comedy Festival in Boston. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other ImprovBoston credits include &amp;ldquo;Cabin Pressure,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The A-Team,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Real Housewives of the Magick Kingdom,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Lodge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
